Project Description: KotlinDiceSim
Overview
KotlinDiceSim is a fun and interactive dice rolling simulation written in Kotlin. Whether youâ€™re a tabletop gamer, a statistics enthusiast, or just someone who enjoys a good roll of the dice, KotlinDiceSim has you covered. With a simple command-line interface, it allows you to roll virtual dice and experience the thrill of chance.

Key Features
Dice-Rolling Simulation:
KotlinDiceSim lets you roll standard six-sided dice (D6) virtually.
Each roll generates a random number between 1 and 6, just like real-world dice.
User-Friendly Interface:
The text-based interface makes it easy to interact with the app.
Simply input the number of dice you want to roll, and KotlinDiceSim handles the rest.
Customizable Dice Types:
Want to roll a different type of dice? No problem! Modify the code to simulate any-sided dice (D4, D8, D20, etc.).
KotlinDiceSim is flexible and adaptable.
Learn Kotlin Basics:
Dive into the code and explore Kotlin features.
Practice concepts like random number generation, loops, and user input.
Try It Out
Run Locally: Execute KotlinDiceSim directly from your favorite IDE or command line.
Learn and Modify: Study the code, tweak it, and make it your own.
Join the Dice Adventure
KotlinDiceSim isnâ€™t just about numbersâ€”itâ€™s about the joy of rolling dice, the anticipation of the outcome, and the camaraderie of fellow gamers. Join our community, contribute enhancements, and letâ€™s keep those dice rolling!
